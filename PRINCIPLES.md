# The Six Principles of JFMAD

**Joseph Fagan's Method for Agile AI-Driven Development**

## 1. Model-Native Role Assignment

Don't role-play — cast. Each AI model is chosen for a role because it is genuinely better at that function. The role fits the tool, not the other way around.

**In practice:** Claude as Architect. ChatGPT as PM. Gemini as Tech Lead. Your developer ships code. You set direction. This isn't one model pretending to be five people — it's five different intelligences doing what they're each best at.

**Test:** Can you explain *why* this specific model is better at this specific role? If not, you're role-playing, not casting.

---

## 2. Adversarial Consensus

Every decision gets pressure-tested at each level before reaching implementation. Architecture gets challenged by process constraints. Sequencing gets validated against technical feasibility. Nothing reaches code without surviving the gauntlet.

**The friction is the feature.**

**Chain of command:** Visionary → Architect → PM → Tech Lead → Developer

**Test:** Was there a moment where one team member pushed back on another's decision? If every idea flows through unchallenged, your process is decorative.

## 3. Constitutional Governance

The system is governed by a living constitution — not a requirements document, but a behavioral contract that defines what the product is, how the AI behaves, what's non-negotiable, and why.

Every sprint spec, architecture decision, and behavioral calibration traces back to the constitution.

**Test:** Can you point to the constitutional principle that justifies this design decision? If not, the decision is unanchored.

---

## 4. Client as Co-Creator

The end user is not a passive stakeholder. Their feedback is treated as constitutional amendments — direct inputs that reshape how the system reasons.

Their exact phrasing matters. Their preferences become system constraints. Their discomfort is a calibration signal, not a bug report.

**Test:** When the client gave feedback, did it change a document or just a task? If it only changed a task, you're not treating them as a co-creator.

---

## 5. Institutional Memory via Documentation

No single AI session holds the full picture. Your documentation workspace serves as the team's shared brain — Constitution, Roadmap, Principals, Sprint Plans, Methodology.

You point to docs instead of re-explaining context.

**If it's not documented, it didn't happen. If it's documented, it's the source of truth.**

**Test:** If you started a fresh AI session right now with zero chat history, could you hand it three documents and have it resume productive work? If not, your institutional memory has gaps.

---

## 6. Plain Text Directives

All instructions to the development team are delivered as plain text in chat, never as documents or files.

This prevents misinterpretation and keeps the implementation layer focused on exactly what was specified.

**Test:** Can the developer read the directive and know precisely what to build without opening any attachments? If not, simplify.
