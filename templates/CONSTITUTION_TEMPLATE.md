# [Product Name] — Operating Constitution

**Version:** 1.0
**Owner:** [Your Name]
**Last Updated:** [Date]

> This is the governing document for [Product Name]. Every sprint spec, architecture decision, and behavioral calibration traces back to this document. If it's not here or doesn't trace here, it's unanchored.

## What This Product Is

[One paragraph. What does it do? Who does it serve? What problem does it solve?]

---

## What This Product Is NOT

[Equally important. What are you deliberately not building? What adjacent ideas have you rejected and why?]

---

## Who This Is Built For

[Describe your user. Not a persona — a real person or type of person. What do they care about? What would embarrass them? What would waste their time?]

---

## Design Principles (Non-Negotiable)

These are locked. Changing them requires explicit discussion and constitutional amendment.

1. **[Principle 1]** — [Why this is non-negotiable]
2. **[Principle 2]** — [Why this is non-negotiable]
3. **[Principle 3]** — [Why this is non-negotiable]

*This constitution is a living document. It evolves with client feedback and project learning. It does not evolve with feature creep or convenience.*
