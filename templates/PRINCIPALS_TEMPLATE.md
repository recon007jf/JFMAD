# Project Principals — Source of Truth

**Purpose:** This is the canonical reference for every person involved in the project. Before drafting ANY outbound communication that mentions a person by name, verify against this document. No exceptions.

## Why This Document Exists

AI systems pull names, titles, and relationships from config files, environment variables, and conversation history. Any of these can be wrong. A wrong name in an outbound email damages trust instantly.

This document is the single source of truth for human identity within the project. Everything else — env vars, database fields, AI memory — is secondary.

## People

| Full Name | Role | Company | Email | Location | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Name] | [Role] | [Company] | [Email] | [Location] | [Any critical notes] |
| [Name] | [Role] | [Company] | [Email] | [Location] | |

---

## Relationships

- [Describe relevant relationships between principals]
- [Family connections, business partnerships, reporting structures]

---

## Companies

| Company | Who | What |
|---|---|---|
| [Company 1] | [Associated people] | [What this company does in context of the project] |
| [Company 2] | [Associated people] | [What this company does] |

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- [e.g., "Client's last name is X, not Y — env var was wrong"]
- [e.g., "Company A is the client's employer, not their own business"]
- [Document every naming error that has occurred so it never repeats]

## Verification Protocol

Before any outbound communication (email, client-facing document, demo script):

1. Check this document for correct full name and company
2. Do not rely on env vars, config files, or AI reports for human names
3. If unsure, ask the project owner

*This document exists because mistakes happen. The goal is to make sure each mistake happens exactly once.*
