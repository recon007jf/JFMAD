# Ideation Phase

**Where ideas get stress-tested before they become architecture.**

---

## Why This Exists

Most AI-assisted development skips straight from "I have an idea" to "start building." That works for toys. It doesn't work when real users, real money, or your reputation are on the line.

The Ideation Phase sits before everything else in JFMAD. Before you assign roles, before you write a constitution, before anyone touches architecture. It's where you figure out whether the thing you want to build is actually the thing you should build.

## How It Works

You pick one or more structured brainstorming techniques and work through them with an AI model. The key word is "with." The AI isn't generating ideas for you. It's coaching you through a framework that forces you to think differently than you normally would.

This is not a prompt. It's a conversation.

## Techniques

Pick what fits. You don't need all of these. One or two per project is usually enough.

### Six Thinking Hats

Six passes through your idea, each from a different angle:

- **White Hat** (Facts): What data would this need? What do we actually know vs assume?
- **Red Hat** (Gut): What feels right or wrong about this? First instincts, no justification needed.
- **Black Hat** (Risk): What could go wrong? Where does this break?
- **Yellow Hat** (Optimism): What's the best case? Where's the real upside?
- **Green Hat** (Creativity): What if we did it completely differently?
- **Blue Hat** (Process): Are we thinking about this the right way?

### Five Whys

Pick your core assumption and ask "why" five times. Each answer becomes the next question. You'll hit the real reason by the third or fourth why. The fifth usually reveals something you hadn't considered.

Example:
- Why build a to-do app? "People need task management."
- Why do they need task management? "They forget things."
- Why do they forget things? "Too many inputs, no triage."
- Why no triage? "Existing tools treat all tasks as equal."
- Why do tools treat tasks as equal? "Because prioritization is hard to automate."

Now you're not building a to-do app. You're building a triage engine.

### Role-Playing Personas

Invent 3-5 users who would actually use this thing. Not demographics. Real people with real frustrations:

- The overwhelmed freelancer juggling 12 clients
- The ADHD creative who starts everything and finishes nothing
- The executive assistant managing someone else's chaos

Walk through your product as each person. What do they need that nobody's giving them?

### Hindsight Analysis

Imagine it's 6 months after launch. The product shipped. Now look back:

- What do you wish you'd included from the start?
- What did you build that nobody uses?
- What one feature do users actually care about?
- What "nice to have" turned out to be the whole point?

This is brutal for cutting scope. The things you'd regret not building are your real MVP. Everything else is post-launch.

### Assumption Reversal

List your five biggest assumptions about the project. Reverse each one. See what happens.

- "Users want more features" becomes "Users want fewer features"
- "This needs to be an app" becomes "This works better as a spreadsheet"
- "We need real-time sync" becomes "Async is actually fine"

Most reversals will be absurd. One or two will make you rethink everything.

## Output

The Ideation Phase produces a **Project Brief**: a short document (1-2 pages) that captures:

- What you're building and why
- Who it's for (specific people, not demographics)
- What's in scope for the MVP and what's not
- Key assumptions you're making
- Risks you've identified
- The one thing this product does that nothing else does

This brief feeds directly into your Constitution. The clearer the brief, the stronger the constitution, the fewer mid-build pivots.

---

## When to Skip This

If you already know exactly what you're building, who it's for, and what the MVP looks like, go straight to Constitutional Governance. Not every project needs formal ideation. But if you're fuzzy on any of those three things, spend an hour here. It'll save you days later.
